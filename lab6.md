# Lab 6: For Loops 

In this lab you will write for-loops. Review the examples in [Class Notes 3](https://github.com/lmansfieldPC/iOSAppDevelopment/blob/main/Class_Notes3.md).

```swift 
//Problem 1/////////////////////////////////////
var names = ["rowan", "nick", "lily"]
//Write a for-loop that prints every name in the array names.
//YOUR CODE HERE


//Problem 2/////////////////////////////////////
//Write a for-loop that prints every multiple of 12 between 1 and 40, inclusive. Hint: use the isMultiple(of:) method.
//YOUR CODE HERE
//This should print: 12, 24, and 36.


//Problem 3/////////////////////////////////////
//Write a for-loop that sums all the numbers from 1 to 10, inclusive, and saves it into a variable total. Print the final value of total.
var total = 0
//YOUR CODE HERE
//This should print: 55


//Problem 4/////////////////////////////////////
let fruits = ["banana", "apple", "pear", "apple", "grape", "apple", "banana", "apple", "grape", "apple", "grape", "apple"]
var count = 0
//Write a for-loop that counts the number of times the word "apple" appears in the array fruits and saves it into the variable count. Print the count.
//YOUR CODE HERE
//This should print: 6


//Problem 5/////////////////////////////////////
var x = 7
//Write a for-loop that adds x to itself 20 times.
//YOUR CODE HERE
//This should print: 7340032

//Problem 6/////////////////////////////////////
let numbers = [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 11, 17, 20, 35, 33, 38]
var oddTotal = 0
//Write a for loop that calculators the sum of all the odd numbers in the array numbers and saves it into oddTotal. Print the final value of oddTotal.
//YOUR CODE HERE
//This should print: 171
