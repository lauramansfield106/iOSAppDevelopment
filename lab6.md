# Lab 6: For-Loops 

In this lab you will write for-loops. Review the examples in [Class Notes 3](https://github.com/lmansfieldPC/iOSAppDevelopment/blob/main/Class_Notes3.md). More examples of notes are also provided in [Class Notes 4](https://github.com/lmansfieldPC/iOSAppDevelopment/blob/main/Class_Notes4.md).

```swift 
import Foundation

//Problem 1/////////////////////////////////////
var names = ["rowan", "nick", "lily"]
//Write a for-loop that prints every name in the array names.
//YOUR CODE HERE


//Problem 2/////////////////////////////////////
//Write a for-loop that prints every multiple of 12 between 1 and 40, inclusive. Hint: use the isMultiple(of:) method.
//YOUR CODE HERE
//This should print: 12, 24, and 36.


//Problem 3/////////////////////////////////////
//Write a for-loop that sums all the numbers from 1 to 10, inclusive, and saves it into a variable total. Print the final value of total.
var total = 0
//YOUR CODE HERE
//This should print: 55


//Problem 4/////////////////////////////////////
let fruits = ["banana", "apple", "pear", "apple", "grape", "apple", "banana", "apple", "grape", "apple", "grape", "apple"]
var count = 0
//Write a for-loop that counts the number of times the word "apple" appears in the array fruits and saves it into the variable count. Print the count.
//YOUR CODE HERE
//This should print: 6


//Problem 5/////////////////////////////////////
var x = 7
//Write a for-loop that adds x to itself 20 times.
//YOUR CODE HERE
//This should print: 7340032

//Problem 6/////////////////////////////////////
let numbers = [10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 11, 17, 20, 35, 33, 38]
var oddTotal = 0
//Write a for-loop that calculators the sum of all the odd numbers in the array numbers and saves it into oddTotal. Print the final value of oddTotal.
//YOUR CODE HERE
//This should print: 171

//Problem 7/////////////////////////////////////
//This one is a bit tricky!
let values = [10, 15, 20, 12, 8, 13]
var max = values[0] //default value for values is 10
//Write a for-loop that finds the maximum value in the array values and stores it into the variable max. If you've done it correctly, max should be 20
//YOUR CODE HERE


//Problem 8 - EXTRA CREDIT IF YOU CAN FIGURE IT OUT ON YOUR OWN! /////////////////////////////////////
//Here is another fun one!
//Write a for-loop that prints all the prime numbers between 1 and 30.
//YOUR CODE HERE
