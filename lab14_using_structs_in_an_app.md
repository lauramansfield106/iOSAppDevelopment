# Lab 14 - Using Structs in an App

Use [Class Notes 9](
https://github.com/lmansfieldPC/iOSAppDevelopment/blob/main/Class_Notes9_UsingStructsInApps.md) for reference.

## Objective 
Create an application call Pet Collector where a user can add different types of pets like cats, dogs, birds, fish, etc.

### Key Features:
- **Name and Color Inputs**: Users can enter a name and choose a color for each pet.
- **Type Selection**: Users can select the type of pet (e.g., Cat, Bird, Fish) using a Picker or segmented control.
- **ScrollView Display**: Added pets are displayed in a scrollable view with an icon that corresponds to the pet type and color.

You can choose to use the application providing in Class Notes 9 as the starter code OR It would be good practice to start your app from scratch. 

Your app must be aesthetically pleasing, easy to user, and use Structs for each animal type.
