# Lab 2: Exploring Constants, Variables, and Data Types in Swift

### Objective

By the end of this lab, students will understand how to work with constants, variables, and different data types in Swift. They will practice initializing, modifying, and using these elements in various scenarios.

### Advice: Work with a partner, ask questions, and refer to the notes! [Class Notes 2](https://github.com/lauramansfield106/iOSAppDevelopment/blob/main/Class_Notes2.md)

### Set-Up
   - Create a new playground in Xcode and name it `Lab2_ConstantsVariables`.
   - If you don't have Xcode yet, use https://www.programiz.com/swift/online-compiler/. You will save your code into a Google doc for submission.
### Part 1: Constants vs. Variables

1. **Initializing a Variable and a Constant:**
   - Write code to:
     - Initialize a <b>variable</b> `myAge` with your age.
     - Initialize a <b>constant</b> `birthYear` with your birth year.
   - Try to reassign the value of each variable, and observe what happens. Write down your observations as a <b>comment</b> in your code.

### Part 2: Working with Data Types

1. **Data Types Initialization:**
   - In the same file, initialize the following variables:
     - An integer `myScore` with a value of 95.
     - A double `myDouble` with your favorite decimal number.
     - A boolean `likesEggs` with a value of `true` or `false`.
     - A string `myFavoriteShow` with a value of the name of one of your favorite shows.
     - A string `myFavoriteMove` with a value of the name of one of your favorite movies.

2. **Exploring Operations:**
   - Which of these variables can you combine using the `+` operator. Complete a few examples that work, for example, `pi + myScore`. Can you use casting to make other combinations work?

### Part 3: String Interpolation and Compound Operations

1. **String Interpolation:**
   - Use string interpolation to create a sentence that describes your score, using the `myScore` variable from above.
   - Your program should print: "I scored 95 points on my last test."

2. **Compound Operators:**
   - Use the compound operators to modify `myScore`:
     - Increase `myScore` by 5.
     - Decrease `myScore` by 2.
   - Print the results after each operation.

### Part 4: Coding Task
   - Create a program that calculates the average of three test scores and prints the result using string interpolation.
   - The program should include:
     - Variables for each test score.
     - A calculation of the average.
     - A string that prints the message: "The average score is X.", where X is the avaerage of the 3 scores.
