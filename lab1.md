# Lab 1

In this lab, you will be exposed to your first Swift code and familiarize yourself with the language by unscrambling lines of code.

I'd recommend you work with a partner!

Since you might not have your local environments set-up yet, we will use the online Swift editor https://swiftplayground.run/ to run Swift code. There are a number of free online Swift compilers. You can use any one you'd like.
