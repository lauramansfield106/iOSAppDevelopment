# Lab 1

In this lab, you will be exposed to your first Swift code and familiarize yourself with the language by unscrambling lines of code.

I'd recommend you work with a partner!

Since you might not have your local environments set-up yet, we will use the online Swift editor https://swiftplayground.run/ to run Swift code. There are a number of free online Swift compilers. You can use any one you'd like.

Instructions:

1. There are 5 coding challenges below. Each challenge includes all the lines for a successful program. But the order of the lines in incorrect. You must rearrange the lines until the program runs as expected.
2. Copy and paste the starter code into https://swiftplayground.run/ to run in and test your rearrangement of the lines.
3. When you have finished, copy and paste your code into a file (a Google doc will do), and submit it to the Hub. 

## Coding Challenges
 ### Challenge 1
```
let num2 = 20
print("The sum is \(sum)")
let num1 = 10
let sum = num1 + num2
```
